The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. 
Through this project, I learned the fundamentals of deep learning, including data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and prediction.


Here's what I did:
1-Installation of Necessary Libraries: I began by ensuring that I had the required libraries installed, such as TensorFlow and Keras, which are essential 
for building and training the deep learning model.

2-Loading and Exploring the Data: I loaded the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, along with their corresponding labels. 
I explored the dataset to understand its structure and gain insights into the nature of the data.

3-Data Preprocessing: Before feeding the data into the model, I preprocessed it to ensure that it was in a suitable format for training. 
This involved tasks such as normalizing the pixel values and reshaping the images.

4-Building the Deep Learning Model: Using TensorFlow and Keras, I constructed a deep learning model architecture. 
This involved defining the layers of the neural network, including input, hidden, and output layers, as well as specifying activation functions and optimization algorithms.

5-Training the Model: With the model architecture in place, I trained it using the preprocessed MNIST dataset. 
During training, the model learned to recognize patterns and features in the images associated with each digit.

6-Evaluating the Model: Once training was complete, I evaluated the performance of the model using a separate test dataset. 
This allowed me to assess how well the model generalized to unseen data and measure its accuracy in classifying digits.

7-Prediction with the Model: Finally, I used the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen handwritten digit images. 
This demonstrated the practical utility of the model in recognizing digits in real-world scenarios.


Overall, this project provided me with a hands-on learning experience in developing and training a deep learning model for image classification tasks, 
laying the foundation for further exploration and experimentation in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
